Sure, here is a good GitHub README file for the above code:


# Image to TIFF Converter

This repository contains a Python script that converts an image to TIFF format and resizes it until it reaches a minimum size.

## Usage

To use the script, simply run the following command:


python convert_to_tiff.py <input_image_path> <output_image_path>


Where:

* `<input_image_path>` is the path to the input image.
* `<output_image_path>` is the path to the output image.

The script will create a new TIFF image at the specified output path. The image will be resized until it reaches the minimum size specified in the script.

## Requirements

The script requires the following Python libraries:

* `PIL`
* `alive_progress`
* `colorama`

## Example

The following example shows how to convert a PNG image to TIFF format and resize it until it reaches a minimum size of 10MB:


python convert_to_tiff.py image.png output.tiff


This will create a new TIFF image at `output.tiff` that is resized until it reaches a minimum size of 10MB.
